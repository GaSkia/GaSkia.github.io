        <p>Still improving this—typos and spaghetti flow ahead. Read at your own risk!</p>
        <h1>Welcome to my Spaghetti-Free Blog.</h1>
        <p>Together we will learn how to leave spaghetti in the kitchen, away from the code!</p>
        
        <div>
            <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Because seeing too much spaghetti-code physically hurts me.</li>
                <li>Because some devs never learned <strong>how</strong> to think properly, only how to write code.</li>
                <li>Because once you know how to think, you naturally become a better developer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You'll Learn Here</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The fundamentals of low-level programming in C.</li>
                <li>The <strong>real</strong> core of Object-Oriented Programming (not just "write classes").</li>
                <li>The power of Design Patterns and when to actually use them.</li>
                <li>How to think <strong>actively</strong> and solve problems, not just follow tutorials.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>The Fundamentals of Low-Level Programming in C</h3>
            <p>Even though C is not very popular these days, it's still a good place to start as it teaches you how a computer works, how to manage memory, and the importance of raw performance.</p>
            
            <h4>Variable Types</h4>
            <h5>Preface</h5>
            <p>Data in computer science is represented by sequences of 1s and 0s. A sequence made of one element is called a bit, and eight bits make up a byte. That said, let's start.</p>
            <p>C supports the following variable types:
                <ul>
                    <li>short</li>
                    <li>int</li>
                    <li>char</li>
                    <li>long</li>
                    <li>float</li>
                    <li>double</li>
                </ul>
                Each of these types, except for <strong>char</strong>, can be represented with or without a sign, meaning they can store negative numbers if the <strong>signed</strong> keyword is used. Otherwise, they represent only positive values when using the <strong>unsigned</strong> keyword.

                <p>Here’s a comparison of how these types differ in terms of their ranges:</p>

                    <thead>

            If you're a greedy learner like me you might be asking yourself how to represent numbers with a decimal part; this is where float and double come for help us.<br>
            As for inte
            <table>
                <caption>Ranges for short, int, long, float, and decimal Types</caption>
                <thead>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>float</td>
                        <td>±1.5 × 10^−45 to ±3.4 × 10^38</td>
                        <td>0 to 3.4 × 10^38</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>double</td>
                        <td>±5.0 × 10^−324 to ±1.7 × 10^308</td>
                        <td>0 to 1.7 × 10^308</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            </p>
            <p>
            As you can see a double is more precise when compared to a float but it needs more ram, just like your browser when you're coding.
