        <p>Still improving thisâ€”typos and spaghetti flow ahead. Read at your own risk!</p>
        <h1>Welcome to my Spaghetti-Free Blog.</h1>
        <p>Together we will learn how to leave spaghetti in the kitchen, away from the code!</p>
        <div>
            <h2>Why I Started This Blog.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Because seeing too much spaghetti-code physically hurts me.</li>
                <li>Because some devs never learned <strong>how</strong> to think properly, only how to write code.</li>
                <li>Because once you know how to think, you naturally become a better developer.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What You'll Learn Here.</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The fundamentals of low-level programming in C.</li>
                <li>The **real** core of Object-Oriented-Programming (not just "write classes").</li>
                <li>The power of Design-Patterns and when to actually use them.</li>
                <li>How to think <strong>actively</strong> and solve problems, not just follow tutorials</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>The Fundamentals Of Low-Level Programming in C</h2>
            <p>
                Even though C is not very popular in these days it's still a good place to start, it teaches you
                how a computer works, how to manage memory and raw performance.

            <h3>
                Variables Type.
            </h3>
            <h4>Preface.</h4>
            <p>Data in computer science is represented by sequences of 0 and 1, a sequence made of one element is called a bit and eight bits made up a byte. That said we can start.</p>
            <p>
            Standard C89 libraries supports these variable types:
            <ul>
                <li>short</li>
                <li>int</li>
                <li>char</li>
                <li>long</li>
                <li>float</li>
                <li>double</li>
            </ul>
            Every of these type excpet <strong>char</strong> can be represented with or without sign, this means that if you don't specify it, they can also store negative numbers.
            short, int and long all represent integers but with a neat difference. short uses 16 bits (2 bytes), storing values from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>65,535</strong> when <strong>unsigned</strong> 
            when you don't use the <strong>unsigned</strong> keyword.
